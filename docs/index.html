        <h2>Squirrels & Climate Change</h2>
        <p>Squirrels, especially species like the Eastern gray squirrel, play a crucial role in forest ecosystems through their behavior of burying nuts and seedsâ€”a practice known as scatter-hoarding. This activity not only ensures their survival during scarce periods but also significantly contributes to forest regeneration and climate change mitigation.</p>
        <p><strong>Forest Regeneration:</strong> Squirrels bury numerous nuts and seeds, some of which they fail to retrieve. These forgotten caches have the potential to germinate and grow into new trees, thereby aiding in natural reforestation efforts. This process supports biodiversity and helps maintain healthy forest ecosystems.</p>
        <p><strong>Climate Change Mitigation:</strong> The growth of new trees from these buried seeds enhances carbon sequestration, as trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. By facilitating the spread and growth of trees, squirrels indirectly contribute to reducing greenhouse gas concentrations, playing a subtle yet important role in combating climate change.</p>
