        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>Our VR game offers an immersive experience where players navigate the world as a squirrel and a lumberjack. You'll learn about the behaviors of squirrels, including their nut-burying habits, and how these actions contribute to forest health and climate change mitigation. You can also play as a lumberjack, clearing land responsibly while learning about sustainable forestry.</p>

        <h2>Squirrels & Climate Change</h2>
        <p>Squirrels play a vital role in forest regeneration and climate mitigation through their seed-burying behaviors, while lumberjacks highlight human interaction with forests. Together, they demonstrate the balance of nature and sustainable practices.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Forest Regeneration:</strong> Squirrels bury nuts and seeds, some of which germinate and grow into new trees, aiding natural reforestation.</li>
            <li><strong>Climate Change Mitigation:</strong> New tree growth supports carbon sequestration, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and helping combat climate change.</li>
            <li><strong>The Lumberjack's Role:</strong> Sustainable land use practices help preserve forest ecosystems while ensuring the responsible harvesting of timber.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="species" class="container">
        <h2>Squirrel Species and Their Ecological Impact</h2>
        <p>There are many species of squirrels around the world, each playing a vital role in forest ecosystems. Some examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eastern Gray Squirrel:</strong> Known for their adaptability, they help in forest regeneration by burying seeds and nuts, some of which sprout into trees.</li>
            <li><strong>Red Squirrel:</strong> Found across Europe and North America, they contribute to seed dispersal, promoting plant diversity.</li>
            <li><strong>Flying Squirrel:</strong> These nocturnal creatures are excellent at spreading fungi spores, essential for forest health.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="climate-change" class="container">
        <h2>Deforestation & Climate Change</h2>
        <p>Deforestation contributes to nearly 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This impacts wildlife habitats, human livelihoods, and accelerates climate change.</p>
        <p>Responsible forest management and reforestation efforts can help restore ecosystems and mitigate the effects of climate change. Together with the efforts of squirrels, we can make a significant impact on climate change.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sustainable-forestry" class="container">
        <h2>Sustainable Forestry Practices</h2>
        <p>Sustainable forestry practices aim to balance the need for timber, biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem health. These practices include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Selectively Cutting Trees:</strong> Ensuring that only mature trees are cut down to allow new growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Reforestation:</strong> Planting multiple saplings for every tree removed to help maintain the balance of the ecosystem.</li>
            <li><strong>Protecting Habitats:</strong> Sustainable forestry also aims to protect the natural habitats of wildlife, including squirrels, ensuring biodiversity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>The game was built using Unity Engine with a focus on creating an immersive and educational experience. Key steps in the development process included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Researching the ecological impact of squirrels and lumberjacks on forests.</li>
            <li>Designing 3D models and animations to simulate the behaviors of squirrels and the actions of lumberjacks.</li>
            <li>Incorporating educational content to enhance player understanding of sustainable practices.</li>
            <li>Testing the game for smooth performance and user engagement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This development journey aimed to create a balance between fun gameplay and impactful learning.</p>
